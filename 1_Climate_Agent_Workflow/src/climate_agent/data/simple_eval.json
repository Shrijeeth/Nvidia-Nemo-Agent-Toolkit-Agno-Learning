    "question": "What was the average temperature in Austria ? Please provide the numerical value.",
    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking for the average temperature in Austria. Let me figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a tool that can provide the average temperature for a specific country. Looking at the available tools, there's the 'calculate_statistics' function which can compute temperature statistics globally or for a specific country. The parameters require specifying the country, so I should use that.\n\nWait, the 'calculate_statistics' tool's parameters are under 'kwargs', which is an object. Since the user mentioned Austria, I need to pass the country name as a parameter. But the tool's parameters don't have explicit properties, so maybe I can just include 'country' in the kwargs. The description says it's for a specific country, so I should structure the arguments accordingly.\n\nSo, the function call should be to 'calculate_statistics' with arguments like {\"country\": \"Austria\"}. That should retrieve the mean temperature for Austria. Let me make sure there's no other tool that's more appropriate. The 'filter_by_country' tool gives info about the country's data but not the actual statistics. So 'calculate_statistics' is the right choice.\n\nI should generate the tool call with the country specified. Once I get the response, I can extract the mean_temperature value and present it to the user.\n</think>\n\n<think>\nOkay, the user asked for the average temperature in Austria. I need to provide the numerical value. Let me check the tool response from the calculate_statistics function.\n\nLooking at the response, the mean_temperature is 8.08°C. That's the average they're asking for. The other details like min, max, standard deviation, and trend are there, but the user specifically wants the average. \n\nI should present the answer clearly, stating the average temperature is 8.08°C. Also, maybe mention the time period analyzed, which is 1950-2025, to give context. But the user didn't ask for the time frame, so maybe keep it concise. Just the number and the unit. \n\nWait, the user said \"Please provide the numerical value.\" So they want just the number. But including the unit is important. So the answer should be 8.08°C. \n\nI should make sure there's no confusion. The tool response has the data, so I can directly quote that. No need for extra explanation unless required. \n\nDouble-check if there's any other step needed. The user didn't ask for anything else, so just the average. Alright, that's straightforward.\n</think>\n\nThe average temperature in Austria is **8.08°C** (based on data from 1950 to 2025)."
